Project Description

Our game is called Celebrity Adventure. 
 	Before the game begins, players will have the option to choose which celebrity they would like as a player
from four different options: Kanye West, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian, and Miley Cyrus.  Each character will have
his or her own game screen similar to that of a Mario game.  The game screens are obstacle courses specific to the
celebrities. The character will constantly be walking to the right, and the player will use the arrow keys as
controls to run, duck, and jump.  As the player progresses throughout the game, there will be various collectable
items along the way that increase the charecter's health such as bonuses.  In addition to bonuses, there will be
obstacles that are both avoidable and unavoidable, and the player will have to make a decision on how they want to
overcome those that are unavoidable.  The other obstacles can be avoided by using the arrow keys, or "a", "s", "w", 
and "d".  The objective of the game is for the player to move his or her character safely through the adventure to the end 
without depleting all of the celebrity's health, therefore losing his or her celebrity status.
							HAVE FUN.
