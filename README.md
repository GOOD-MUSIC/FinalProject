Project Description: 
Our game is called Celebrity Adventure. Players will choose the celebrity that they want to be from 4 options: Kanye 			West, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian, and Miley Cyrus. Each character has a different game screen similar to that of a 			Mario game. The screens are obstacle courses specific to the celebrities. The celebrity will constantly be walking to 		the right, and the player will use the arrow keys to run, duck, and jump. Along the way, there will be items to collect 	that add to the charecter's health. There will also be obstacles that are unavoidable, and the player will have to make 	a decision to overcome them. The object of the game is to get to the end of the adventure without depleting all of your 	health and losing your celebrity status.
