Project Description

	Our game is called Celebrity Adventure. 
	Before the start of the game, players will have the option to choose which celebrity they would like to play as from four different options: Kanye West, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian, and Miley Cyrus.  Each character will have his or her own game screen similar to that of a Mario game.  The game screens are obstacle courses specific to the celebrities. The character will constantly be walking to the right, and the player will use the arrow keys as controls to run, duck, and jump.  As the player progresses throughout the game, there will be various collectable items along the way that increase the charecter's health such as bonuses.  In addition to bonuses, there will be obstacles that are both avoidable and unavoidable, and the player will have to make a decision on how they want to overcome them.  The avoidable obstacles can be overcome by using arrow keys.  For the unavoidable obstacles, the player will come across them at some point in the game and speak to them.  The objective of the game is for the player to move his or her character safely through the adventure to the end, without depleting all of the celebrity's health, and possibly losing his or her celebrity status.
							HAVE FUN.
